# SEED-Gigi-Slang LTC Fit

[Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTC) fitting](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/415-2/) implementation using Slang autodifferentiation in Gigi.

This project implements LTC fitting for real-time polygonal-light shading using Slang's automatic differentiation capabilities in [Electronic Art's SEED Gigi](https://github.com/electronicarts/gigi).

## Features

- Slang-based LTC fitting with automatic differentiation
- HLSL shader implementations for initialization, fitting, and rendering
- Integration with Gigi framework
- Based on state-of-the-art real-time area lighting techniques
